    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Bread dough:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
      <li>1.00 cup whole fat plain Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Garlic Topping:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic granules</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine flour, yogurt, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, and salt in a
        bowl; mix to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust work surface with more flour. Transfer dough to work surface. Knead
        dough for 8 to 10 minutes with the palm of your hand. Add more flour (1
        teaspoon at a time) as needed to keep dough from being too sticky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat (such as Silpat®).
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape dough into a rounded loaf. Using a bench scraper, cut off 8 wedges
        of dough. Roll each wedge of dough into a rope shape and tie into knots.
        Place knots onto the prepared baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until knots are lightly browned, 10 to 12
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine melted butter, oil, garlic granules, and parsley for
        topping in a small glass bowl. Brush mixture over the warm knots.
      </li>
    </ol>
